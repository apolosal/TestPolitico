# Design Guidelines: Test Pol√≠tico Argentino

## Design Approach
**Selected Framework:** Material Design with Quiz Platform Patterns
**Rationale:** This is a utility-focused, information-dense application where clarity and usability are paramount. We'll draw inspiration from successful quiz platforms (Political Compass, 8values, BuzzFeed quizzes) while maintaining a clean, professional aesthetic appropriate for political content.

## Core Design Principles
1. **Clarity First:** Every question and option must be immediately readable
2. **Trust & Authority:** Design should feel credible for political content
3. **Mobile-Optimized:** Quiz will likely be shared on social media
4. **Minimal Distraction:** No competing visual elements during test-taking

## Images
**No images required** - This is a text-focused quiz application where clarity and speed are prioritized. The design relies on strong typography, spacing, and minimal UI elements to create a professional, distraction-free experience.

## Key Visual Details
- **Shadows:** Use sparingly - shadow-md for cards, shadow-lg for elevated states
- **Borders:** Consistent 2px borders for interactive elements
- **Rounded corners:** rounded-lg (8px) for buttons/cards, rounded-full for progress bars
- **Transitions:** Fast and subtle (duration-200) - avoid slow animations
